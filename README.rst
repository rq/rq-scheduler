RQ Scheduler
============

`RQ Scheduler <https://github.com/ui/rq-scheduler>`_ is a small package that
adds job scheduling capabilities to `RQ <https://github.com/nvie/rq>`_,
a `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_ based Python queuing library.

============
Requirements
============

* `RQ`_

============
Installation
============

You can install `RQ Scheduler`_ via pip::

    pip install rq-scheduler

Or you can download the latest stable package from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rq-scheduler>`_.

=====
Usage
=====

Schedule a job involves doing two different things:
# Putting a job in the scheduler
# Running a scheduler that will move scheduled jobs into queues when the time comes

----------------
Scheduling a Job
----------------

There are two ways you can schedule a job. The first is using RQ Scheduler's ``enqueue_at``::

    from rq import use_connection
    from rq_scheduler import Scheduler
    from datetime import datetime

    use_connection() # Use RQ's default Redis connection
    scheduler = Scheduler() # Get a scheduler for the "default" queue

    # Puts a job into the scheduler. The API is similar to RQ except that it
    # takes a datetime object as first argument. So for example to schedule a
    # job to run on Jan 1st 2020 we do:
    scheduler.enqueue_at(datetime(2020, 1, 1), func)

    # Here's another example scheduling a job to run at a specific date and time,
    # complete with args and kwargs
    scheduler.enqueue_at(datetime(2020, 1, 1, 3, 4), func, foo, bar=baz)


The second way is using ``enqueue_in``. Instead of taking a ``datetime`` object,
this method expects a ``timedelta`` and schedules the job to run at
X seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks later. For example, if we want to monitor how
popular a tweet is a few times during the course of the day, we could do something like::

    from datetime import timedelta

    # Schedule a job to run 10 minutes, 1 hour and 1 day later
    scheduler.enqueue_in(timedelta(minutes=10), count_retweets, tweet_id)
    scheduler.enqueue_in(timedelta(hours=1), count_retweets, tweet_id)
    scheduler.enqueue_in(timedelta(days=1), count_retweets, tweet_id)


You can also explicitly pass in ``connection`` to use a different Redis server::

    from redis import Redis
    from rq_scheduler import Scheduler
    from datetime import datetime

    scheduler = Scheduler('default', connection=Redis('192.168.1.3', port=123))
    scheduler.enqueue_at(datetime(2020, 01, 01, 1, 1), func)

------------------------
Periodic & Repeated Jobs
------------------------

As of version 0.3, `RQ Scheduler`_ also supports creating periodic and repeated jobs.
You can do this via the ``schedule`` method. Note that this feature needs
`RQ`_ >= 0.3.1.

This is how you do it::

    scheduler.schedule(
        scheduled_time=datetime.now(), # Time for first execution
        func=func,                     # Function to be queued
        args=[arg1, arg2],             # Arguments passed into function when executed
        kwargs={'foo': 'bar'},       # Keyword arguments passed into function when executed
        interval=60,                   # Time before the function is called again, in seconds
        repeat=10                      # Repeat this number of times (None means repeat forever)
    )

---------------
Canceling a job
---------------

To cancel a job, simply do:

    scheduler.cancel(job)

---------------------
Running the scheduler
---------------------

`RQ Scheduler`_ comes with a script ``rqscheduler`` that runs a scheduler
process that polls Redis once every minute and move scheduled jobs to the
relevant queues when they need to be executed::

    # This runs a scheduler process using the default Redis connection
    rqscheduler

If you want to use a different Redis server you could also do::

    rqscheduler --host localhost --port 6379 --db 0

The script accepts these arguments:

* ``-H`` or ``--host``: Redis server to connect to
* ``-p`` or ``--port``: port to connect to
* ``-d`` or ``--db``: Redis db to use
* ``-P`` or ``--password``: password to connect to Redis

=========
Changelog
=========

Version 0.3.2:

* Periodic jobs now require `RQ`_ >= 0.3.1

Version 0.3:

* Added the capability to create periodic (cron) and repeated job using ``scheduler.enqueue``
